- This section is for Kodi builders to add their own custom Trakt keys.

- Keys added here are obfuscated using asterisks and are persistent after add-on updates/revokes.

- To use this feature you simply select enable, add your custom keys, and select OK to save. Then zip your build to include the keys.

- If you do not already have keys, follow the link below to create them.
