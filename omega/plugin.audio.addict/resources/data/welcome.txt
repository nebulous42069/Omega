This seems to be the first time you are using the AudioAddict addon since you didn't specify a 'ListenKey' in the addon settings. In order to listen to any stream you'll need a premium account at one of the following websites:

  [COLOR FF007EFF]http://www.di.fm[/COLOR]
  [COLOR FF007EFF]http://www.radiotunes.com[/COLOR]
  [COLOR FF007EFF]http://www.rockradio.com[/COLOR]
  [COLOR FF007EFF]http://www.jazzradio.com[/COLOR]
  [COLOR FF007EFF]http://www.classicalradio.com[/COLOR]

One account at any of these websites is enough and will be valid for all radio networks. Your premium 'ListenKey' can be extracted from the 'PlayerSettings' on any of the above mentioned websites.
