"I found this addon in a non-working state and the original developer seemed to have abandoned the project. "
"In Kodi v18 and earlier the addon required only a few small code tweaks to get it working reasonably well; "
"however, when Kodi v19 was released, the code required major refactoring to upgrade it from Python2 to Python3. "
"I decided to take on that venture and have enjoyed the results! I hope you do as well. \n\n"
"To submit feature requests or bug reports, see the Kodi forum:\n"

"[I]This is the original 'about' summary from the original developer:[/I]\n\n"
"[B]Thanks for trying the Movie Quiz, I hope you are enjoying it.[/B]\n\n"
"I initially started working on the addon in January 2011, when my girlfriend got they idea for guessing a movie based on a random clip. "
"Since then it has evolved into many questions for both movies and tv shows as well as features such as online highscores, etc.\n\n"
"I am continuously improving on it and always glad to get feedback, so please don't hesitate to contact me. "
"You can use the XBMC forums or if you understand Danish you may want to visit my blog, which also has information on the other Danish addons I am working on.\n\n"
