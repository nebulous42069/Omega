Real-Debrid has a very nasty bug in their torrent cache check endpoint,
[B]"torrents/instantAvailability"[/B].  The issue occurs when RD attempts to cache check a [B]"show"[/B] pack.
The data structure of these pack files seems to cause RD to lag badly in server response time.  This
option allows you to ignore [B]"show"[/B] packs so the lag is not seen and the scrape results will appear
MUCH faster.  I ONLY suggest enabling this feature for users with a secondary debrid account such as
[B]AD[/B] and,or [B]PM[/B] that do NOT suffer this endpoint issue.
