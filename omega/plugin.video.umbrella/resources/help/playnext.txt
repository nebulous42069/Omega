for Episodes.  See [COLOR red][B]"System - Settings - Player - Videos - Play next video automatically"[/B][/COLOR].  Then
select [B][COLOR red]Episodes[/B][/COLOR].

NOTE: If you call up [B]Source Select[/B] continual playback will not function.  Continual playback ONLY operates in AutoPlay mode per above.

PlayNext now has some themes that go with skins included in it. If you have a skin that it has a theme for and you set the setting for 
Enable Playnext Theme it will automatically apply the theme for that skin. More themes will be added later.
