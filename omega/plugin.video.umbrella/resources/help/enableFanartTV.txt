Clear [B]Metadata[/B] and [B]Cache[/B] if you enable this setting from a previous disabled state. There is no need to clear anything if you elect to disable fanart.tv from a previous enabled state, the data will just sit in the database unusued and is preferable if you later wish to enable this.  Note that disabling this offers a speed improvement by bypassing an api request but you will not receive [B]"clearart"[/B], [B]"clearlogo"[/B], [B]"landscape"[/B] or [B]"discart"[/B] by doing so.  This becomes most evident in the player and some skins that makes use of the extended artwork when available in specific view types.
