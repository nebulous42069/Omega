NOTE:
  Trakt scrobble is a means to store your bookmarks to the Trakt api endpoint as a "scrobble pause".
This resume point is sync'd across multiples devices.  If you have more than one device I suggest
using Trakt Scrobble.  If you have only one deivce I suggest staying with the local bookmarks
method.  Do Not enable this setting if you scrobble through the Trakt add-on as conflicted
data occurs and Trakt will not allow multiple scroobles in a short time.
