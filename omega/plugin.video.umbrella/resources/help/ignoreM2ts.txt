[B].m2ts[/B] files can be very large in size between the number of folders and video files.  This setting allows
you to ignore them in your cloud storage.  This should result in a speed increase should they exist and
you chose to ignore them.  Note: if you do not keep .m2ts files in your cloud this setting will have no
effect.  If you choose to keep and view them the performance hit per debrid provider varies.  AD and
PM is very slight while RD seems to take the biggest hit at 1-2second increase in scrape time.
