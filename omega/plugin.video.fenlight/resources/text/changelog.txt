[COLOR darkgoldenrod]GOD BLESS HIM AND KEEP HIM SAFE.[/COLOR]

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.81/82[/B][/COLOR]
- Added 'Anime' section to Root Menu (Main Menu). To add this, context menu on any current Root Menu item->Check for New Menu Items. Add the Anime menu item where you please. If this doesn't work, then select Context Menu->Restore Menu.
- Anime is also included in the "Random Lists" menu, where the Anime lists can be randomized just like the Movie and TV Show lists.
- Added Settings->Content->General->"Watched (Still Airing) TV Shows Location". Select from "Watched", "In Progress" or "Both". This decides which menu fully watched, but still airing, TV Shows will be included in. Default is "Watched" (which is the current behavior).
- Excluded some genres from the "Popular" TV Shows list. Atleast until TMDb get that list sorted out. Clear the Lists cache to get slightly better results there.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.78/79/80[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "AI Enhanced/Upscaled Files Filter" to Settings->Results->Sorting and Filtering. Set to Include, Exclude, Prefer (Autoplay).

- Small adjustments to Extras and People windows.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.76[/B][/COLOR]
- More fine tuning of random widgets, mainly concerning the shortcuts folder. This is quickly becoming messy code though, which I'm not a fan of.
- Other changes/fixes.
- God Bless him and keep him safe.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.75[/B][/COLOR]
- Couple more adjustments to random widgets functions.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.74[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.72/73[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "Single Episode Lists" settings category. Some re-organizing of settings.
- Added Settings->Content->Widgets->"Refresh Widgets on Timer". Enable this, set a timer value, and FenLight will refresh your widgets when the timer is due. Off by default. Also added boolean to enable/disable Notifications when this occurs. If you use "random" widgets (made using the various methods in Fen Light) then you will need to set a value here or else the random widgets will only show fresh random content on each Kodi start.
- Bifurcated (thanks for the new word) Minimum Size setting into movies/episodes for filtering results.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.71[/B][/COLOR]

- Added "People" option to Favorites to go along with Movies and TV Shows.

- Added "Random" as a sort option when making a Discover list. Will provide 20 results from the random algorithm.
- Changed the algorithm slightly for fetching random items for the random lists. Should be just as good, but a little easier on TMDb.
- Fixed Discover lists that include the "Released Only" parameter not updating with new content. Unfortunately, any Discover list made with this param that you want to have update daily will need to be remade.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.66[/B][/COLOR]
- Couple of quick fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.65[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "In Trakt Lists" to movie and tvshow context menu. Also in Extras, and also available to make as a button in Extras.

You will need to re-set your Extras menu settings after this update as control ids have changed for the second time in as many updates.
- Added "Show Special Episodes When Available" to Content->Content.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.64[/B][/COLOR]
- Removed Settings->Features->"Open Extras When Selecting". Replaced with "Special Open Actions" within same Features tab.
- Removed "Use Minimal Media Info" setting.
- Added "More Like This" recommendations to Extras window and context menu of Movies and TV Shows.
- Added rudimentary support for "Special" episodes. I see no use in including these, as there will almost never be sources for playback. But I had the request so here they are. Also, you will not be able to mark them as watched within Fen Light.
- Added "guest star" cast members for TV Show episodes. Will include additional cast appearing in that specific episode. Requested.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.63[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "Open Movie Collections Instead When Available" subsetting to Features->"Open Extras When Selecting". If you enable this and the movie you select is part of a collection, then that collection will be displayed, and the movie selected will be highlighted. This will be instead of opening the Extras window. Selecting the movie again from within the collection results will then open the Extras window.
- Removed Test Repository support.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.62[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "belongs_to_collection" listitem property to movie items. Skins can use this to display whether listitem is part of a collection.

- Other changes/fixes.
- 57: Quick fix.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.55[/B][/COLOR]
- Added Easynews image search.
- Added ability to bind Fen Light's Extras dialog and Options dialog to specific keys/buttons for quick access. This would be done instead of letting Fen Light replace Kodi's Information and Context Menu dialogs as is currently an option. The command for opening the extras dialog is "RunPlugin(plugin://plugin.video.fenlight/?mode=custom_key_extras_menu_choice)", and the Options dialog is "RunPlugin(plugin://plugin.video.fenlight/?mode=custom_key_options_menu_choice)". Restart Kodi if you add these to a keymap.
- Added Settings->Content->Content->"Control Viewtypes within Addon". If your skin is able (through a helper script) to handle "locking" viewtypes, then this functionality in Fen Light can likely be turned OFF as it may not be needed.
- Adedd Settings->Content->Content->"Shuffle Order of Personal/Liked Trakt Lists" to same settings menu.
- Fixed Trakt lists not loading if there is an instance of type: person within the list.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.52[/B][/COLOR]
YOU WILL LIKELY HAVE TO REMAKE ANY WIDGETS OR SHORTCUT FOLDERS THAT CONTAIN RANDOM ITEMS AFTER THIS UPDATE.
- Re-write of Random list handling.
- Dynamic random list widget naming should be sorted out with this update. It is essential that you read the tip "Handling Random Lists for Dynamic Widget Naming" in Tools->Tips For Use. There is a particular way the widgets must be named if you wish to see the correct list name label on random widgets upon each refresh. It is not essential to do this, but it will enhance the experience of using random widgets.
- Added ability to view changes to new online release before choosing to install. If you manually check for an update, or have the update action set to 'Prompt', then you will have a chance to view the changelog of the new release before installing it. You can also check the changelog of the new release via Tools->Changelog & Log Utils->Check Online Version Changelog. 
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.51[/B][/COLOR]
- Qucik fix for "Play Next" in Extras window.
- Random widget labels will have to wait. Bit bigger job than I thought.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.49/50[/B][/COLOR]
- Added ability to assign "Shortcut Folders" as "Random". Using this, you can make the shortcut folder a widget and each refresh of the widget will load a different list from the contents of that shortcut folder. Only movie, tv show, season and episode lists are supported. See Fen Light Tips in the Tools directory for more information.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.48[/B][/COLOR]
- Forgot to mention last update. Changes there will mean you will need to recreate any "Discover" paths you may have made and use.
- Added "Calculate Content Based On" to Content->Next Episodes. Choose "Last Aired" or Last Watched".

[B]"Last Aired" will perform the same as Next Episodes has always performed. It will take the last AIRED episode you have watched and return the next availabe aired episode. "Last Watched" will perform differently. It will take the last WATCHED episode and return the next availabe unwatched episode.[/B]

- Added "Select Source" to Playback Options. Use when autoplay fails to provide the desired file but you don't need to rescrape for sources.
- Hopefully last fixes for watched status issues.

- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.40[/B][/COLOR]
- Removed Playback->Utilities->"Remember Previous Successful Resolves". Short-lived. Didn't seem to work for most people for some reason, and broke Fen Light when it didn't work. I wasn't that enamoured with the feature in the first place, so better to remove it. The same functionality can already be achieved with a couple of settings.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.39[/B][/COLOR]
- Added settings for Trakt Calendar in Settings->Navigation. Choose previous/future days and sort order.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.38[/B][/COLOR]

The highlight color can be set in Results->Results Color Highlights when the setting is enabled.
- Neutralized activation code colors when authorizing debrid providers or Trakt so as to assist colorblind people in seeing the code.
- Other changes/fixes.

- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.23[/B][/COLOR]

- Added Media Images content for Fen Light Extras dialog. Just a list featuring the media's Poster, Fanart & Clearlogo. Will need to be enabled on current installs.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.22[/B][/COLOR]

- Added "Trakt Favorites" to My Lists. Trakt gives users the ability to mark media as a "favorite" on their website. Trakt claims that the media that has been marked as favorites from other Trakt users that you follow will determine the Recommendations they supply to you. So for Trakt Recommendations to work correctly you need to follow other Trakt users that have a similar taste in media to you, and have also set a decent amount of their own favorites.
- Adjustments to Trakt sync values due to looking into the Trakt favorites lists.
- Fixed some post-results filtering.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.19[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "Providers" menu items for Movies and TV Shows. For TV Shows, you will need to navigate into TV Shows and select "Check for New Menu Items" from the context menu. Then you can add the new "Providers" menu item to your TV Show list. If that does not work, you will need to instead select "Restore Menu". For Movies, the "Providers" menu item is replacing the "Networks" menu item. So you will need to either remove the "Networks" menu item and add the Providers menu item the same way as for TV Shows, or you can simply select "Restore Menu" and that will happen automatically.
- Added "Discover" menu item to Main Menu. Here you can make your own custom lists using filters. Browse them from the Discover menu, or add them to any of Fen Light's main menus by using the menu editor. To see the new Discover menu item, follow the steps from above, except from the Main Menu.
- Added Settings->General->Manage Addon Updates-> "Use Test Repository for Updates". There is now a test repository, and enablng this setting will allow Fen Light to update from the test repository. THIS IS NOT ADVISED, as the builds within the test repo may not be stable.
- Improved resolving accuracy with RD sources.
- Quick fix for rounding down of small TV Show progress floats.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.18[/B][/COLOR]

- Added new startup updater to run on Kodi start.
- 2 settings for startup updater in Manage Updates->Startup Update:
        
"Delay Before Running": Choose time in seconds to delay the service after Kodi starts. Defaults to 90 secs. Best not to set this too low.
        
"Update Action": Set this to one of the following. Defaults to Prompt:
                "Prompt": Confirm dialog appears when update available,
                "Automatic": Update without user interaction,
                "Notification": Alert the user of an update with a notification,
                "Off": No update performed or dialog/notification displayed.
