[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.41[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "Rollback to a Previous Version" to Tools. Use this to "rollback" to any version still on the github. Useful if an update is causing issues. I will commit to having at least the previous version available on the github site moving forward.
- Added assignment for "landscape" artwork. Metadata cache will need to be cleared to begin seeing the landscape artwork.
- Added "Random Recommended Movies" and "Random Recommended TV Shows" to the Random Lists section.
- Added context menu listing to delete items in debrid clouds when browsing through My Services.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.40[/B][/COLOR]
- Removed Playback->Utilities->"Remember Previous Successful Resolves". Short-lived. Didn't seem to work for most people for some reason, and broke Fen Light when it didn't work. I wasn't that enamoured with the feature in the first place, so better to remove it. The same functionality can already be achieved with a couple of settings.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.39[/B][/COLOR]
- Added settings for Trakt Calendar in Settings->Navigation. Choose previous/future days and sort order.

- Added settings for maximum size for Movies or Episodes. Changed from a single setting for both. Found at Results->Sorting & Filtering.
- Added Playback->Utilities->"Remember Previous Successful Resolves". Enable this and Fen Light will remember the last successful resolve for a Movie or TV Show and sort it to the top of the results list. The highlight color can be set in Results->Results Color Highlights when the setting is enabled.
- Neutralized activation code colors when authorizing debrid providers or Trakt so as to assist colorblind people in seeing the code.
- Other changes/fixes.

- Added Media Images content for Fen Light Extras dialog. Just a list featuring the media's Poster, Fanart & Clearlogo. Will need to be enabled on current installs.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.20[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "Trakt Favorites" to My Lists. Trakt gives users the ability to mark media as a "favorite" on their website. Trakt claims that the media that has been marked as favorites from other Trakt users that you follow will determine the Recommendations they supply to you. So for Trakt Recommendations to work correctly you need to follow other Trakt users that have a similar taste in media to you, and have also set a decent amount of their own favorites.
- Adjustments to Trakt sync values due to looking into the Trakt favorites lists.
- Fixed some post-results filtering.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.19[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "Providers" menu items for Movies and TV Shows. For TV Shows, you will need to navigate into TV Shows and select "Check for New Menu Items" from the context menu. Then you can add the new "Providers" menu item to your TV Show list. If that does not work, you will need to instead select "Restore Menu". For Movies, the "Providers" menu item is replacing the "Networks" menu item. So you will need to either remove the "Networks" menu item and add the Providers menu item the same way as for TV Shows, or you can simply select "Restore Menu" and that will happen automatically.
- Added "Discover" menu item to Main Menu. Here you can make your own custom lists using filters. Browse them from the Discover menu, or add them to any of Fen Light's main menus by using the menu editor. To see the new Discover menu item, follow the steps from above, except from the Main Menu.
- Added Settings->General->Manage Addon Updates-> "Use Test Repository for Updates". There is now a test repository, and enablng this setting will allow Fen Light to update from the test repository. THIS IS NOT ADVISED, as the builds within the test repo may not be stable.
- Improved resolving accuracy with RD sources.
- Quick fix for rounding down of small TV Show progress floats.
- Other changes/fixes.
